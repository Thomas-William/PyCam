# PyCam :camera:
:movie_camera: A simple python script that records you camera feed into a file! Super lightweight and easy to use.
- Requirements: <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>

## How to use? :thinking:
<b>When you run the script, you'll be prompted if you want to record or not.</b><br>
1 - If you say yes, name your file then you should see you camera feed.<br>
2 - To <b>start recording, press R</b>. Pressing R again will <b>pause the recording</b>. Pressing R again will resume the recording. You get it.<br>
3 - Pressing Q will close the app.<br>
<br>
If you say no, then you can still see your camera feed but nothing will be recorded :black_heart:

## I wanna help! :smile:
Feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/saulojoab/PyCam/issues">issue</a> or make a <a href="https://github.com/saulojoab/PyCam/pulls">pull request</a>.<br>I just did this because I needed to record my camera separatedly but OBS can't do that :joy:<br><br>
